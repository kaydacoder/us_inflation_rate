# Inflation rates correlation with the economic indicators


**Objective:**
To analyse how inflation rates correlate with the economic indicators GDP growth and unemployment rates - in the United States (between 1980-2023).

 1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
 - [ ] Gather historical data for inflation rates, GDP growth, and unemployment rates in the US.
 - [ ] Ensure the dataset is clean, with no missing or incorrect values.

 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

 - [ ] Plot time series graphs for each indicator to visualise trends
       over the years.
 - [ ] Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for
       each indicator.

       
 3. **Correlation Analysis:**
 - [ ] Calculate the correlation coefficients between inflation rates and GDP growth, and between inflation rates and unemployment rates.
 - [ ] Visualise the correlations using scatter plots and regression lines.


4.  **Trend Analysis:**
 - [ ] Analyse how the inflation rate, GDP growth, and unemployment rate have changed over different economic cycles (e.g., recessions, booms).
 - [ ] Identify periods of high and low inflation and examine the
       corresponding GDP growth and unemployment rates during those
       periods.


5.  **Presentation of Findings:**
 - [ ] Summarise the key insights and findings in a report.
 - [ ] Create visualisations (graphs, charts) to support the findings.
 - [ ] Provide policy recommendations or implications based on the
       analysis.
